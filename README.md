# Reinforcement_learning
RL in Trading (Portfolio Abgabe: Pascal Breucker und Luis Steinert

--- 

This repository contains code for training and evaluating reinforcement learning models (A2C and PPO) on a custom environment for a RL Trading Agent. Traded Stock Apple: 'AAPL'. The project is structured as follows:

## Files:

1. `train_single_stock_project.ipynb`: 
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training and evaluating the A2C and PPO models on a custom environment.
   - The notebook also includes the plots of the second model trained with a different reward function in the custom environment.

2. `custom_environment_project.py`:
   - This Python file contains the custom environment used for training the reinforcement learning models (A2C and PPO) in the `train_single_stock_project.ipynb` notebook.

3. `Eval and Tests`:
   - This directory contains the code and data for training the second set of A2C and PPO models with a different reward function in the custom environment.
   - The resulting plots and evaluation metrics of these models are displayed at the end of the `train_single_stock_project.ipynb` notebook.
